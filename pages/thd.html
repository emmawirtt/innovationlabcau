An important part of the fabric of The Home Depot is giving our time, talents, energy, and resoucres to worthwhile causes in our communities and society. Along with our quality products, service, price, and selection, we must go the extra mile to give customers knowledgable advice about merchandise and help them use those products to their maximum benefit.</p>

      <p class="w3-text-grey">The foundation of our commitment to diversity and inclusion was established more than 40 years ago, along with our eight core values. Respect for all people is a top priority for the company, and maintaining The Home Depot's competitive advantage is directly tied to how well our associates reflect the diversity of our customers. 
</p><p>
<p class="w3-text-grey">However, it's not enough for us to simply hire diverse talent. We also cultivate a culture where associates want to stay with
The Home Depot and have opportunities to grow their career with us. Overall, an inclusive and respectful environment means all associates can bring their whole selves to work. This philosophy is the foundation for our continued efforts to promote associate engagement, as well as gain a better understanding of our customers and the communities we serve.
