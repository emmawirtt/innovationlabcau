 <h5> 
You Make Us Diverse. How We Embrace Others Makes Us Inclusive.
	     </h5>
<p> The foundation of our commitment to diversity and inclusion was established more than 40 years ago, along with our eight core values. Respect for all people is a top priority for the company, and maintaining The Home Depot's competitive advantage is directly tied to how well our associates reflect the diversity of our customers.
However, it's not enough for us to simply hire diverse talent. We also cultivate a culture where associates want to stay with The Home Depot and have opportunities to grow their career with us. Overall, an inclusive and respectful environment means all associates can bring their whole selves to work. This philosophy is the foundation for our continued efforts to promote associate engagement, as well as gain a better understanding of our customers and the communities we serve.</p>

The Home Depot created OrangeMethod, a training program that offers IT training for current employees looking to up their skills, as well as training for new employees. </h5>
<p> The Home Depot implemented the OrangeMethod into their onboarding process to ensure all necessary tools and resources are readily available. The OrangeMethod tech boot camp first started as a 12-week program centered around focusing on software engineering. The latest iteration of the tech boot camp is a 16-week course that employees can use to become UX managers, product managers, or software engineers. There are also follow-up recaps and courses on more specific topics. The Home Depot works with Pluralsight that provides a large range of learning options spanning from the classroom to self-paced instruction guides. Below are two videos that go more into depth with what The Home Depot and the OrangeMethod is doing to help its current and future employees be more prepared for the digital transformation age. </p>
